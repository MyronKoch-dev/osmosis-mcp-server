## 🛡️ SECURITY ASSESSMENT

### Security Features Implemented
- ✅ **Testnet by default** - Prevents accidental mainnet transactions
- ✅ **In-memory mnemonic processing** - No persistent storage of sensitive data
- ✅ **Proper message construction** - Automatic sender address filling
- ✅ **Input validation** - All parameters validated before processing
- ✅ **Error handling** - Graceful failure with detailed feedback
- ✅ **Network switching** - Environment variable controls

### Security Recommendations
1. **Always test on testnet first** before mainnet usage
2. **Use small amounts** for initial mainnet testing
3. **Verify addresses carefully** before execution
4. **Keep mnemonic phrases secure** - never log or store them
5. **Set `OSMOSIS_NETWORK=mainnet`** only when ready for production
