## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **UPDATED SECURITY MODEL:**
- **Default Network**: TESTNET (for safety during execution tools testing)
- **Execution Tools**: Can sign and broadcast transactions directly using provided mnemonics
- **Query Tools**: Read-only operations, no private key handling
- **Production Use**: Set `OSMOSIS_NETWORK=mainnet` environment variable for mainnet
- **Mnemonic Handling**: Mnemonics are processed in-memory only, never stored
- **Testnet First**: Always test with testnet before using mainnet funds

## Development

```bash
# Run in development mode with auto-reloading
npm run dev

# Test with the MCP inspector  
npm run inspect

# Run all tests
npm run test

# Validate everything works
npm run validate
```

## Architecture

The server is built with:
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **@modelcontextprotocol/sdk** for MCP protocol implementation  
- **@cosmjs/stargate** for Cosmos SDK interactions
- **osmojs** for Osmosis-specific operations
- **axios** for HTTP API calls
- **zod** for input validation

Each tool category is modular and can be used independently, making the server highly maintainable and extensible.
